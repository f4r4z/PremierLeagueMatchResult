# Premier League Final Result Predictor

This program predicts the final result of a premier league match based on the data given at half time. The program has above 60% accuracy and on average it results in about 65% accuracy.
The final result is in the form of classification with 3 values, 0, 1, and 2 which mean home win, draw, and away win respectively.

### Algorithm
I used neural network in order to implement this program. Different step size, hidden layers, and neurons were tested to increase accuracy.

### Libraries
I used [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to implement this program.

### Data
The data is obtained from [football-data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk/data.php).
